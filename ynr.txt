<span id="y">hey <span id="r">Reese</span>.</span><br>
<span id="r">hey <span id="y">Yevette</span>.</span><br>
<span id="y">whats the point of commentary</span><br>
<span id="r">what do you mean?</span><br>
<span id="y">i mean. this essay we have for tuesday. on the book. what is the point. why do it.</span><br>
<span id="r">well... a lot of it is about showing you know the material, right? the whole idea of taking the class is to learn, and if you want to show the college and whoever else that you've learned, you gotta show that you've thought about what they asked you to think about. do it so they know you know it, so you can get to the next class.</span><br>
<span id="y">i dont care about that. thats not what i mean.</span><br>
<span id="r">ok then. I'm no telepath. what do you mean?</span><br>
<span id="y">like, Roger Ebert isnt writing about what he thinks of Star Wars so that people know he watched and understood Star Wars. why is he writing a critique of Star Wars.</span><br>
<span id="r">presumably he was paid for it.</span><br>
<span id="y">ok ok ok fine whatever say i was in his place and i was writing it and you <b>know</b> i dont care about money as long as i have enough dough to buy the little cups of guacamole at chipotle. what purpose does commentary serve. what fulfillment does it grant.</span><br>
<span id="r">well, think about it this way. there are a lot of people who think that the whole purpose of art is to communicate the perspective of the artist, in its truest form, to other people – people whose perspectives are completely different, who wouldn't even be able to <i>conceive</i> of such a different point of view without that art. so, wouldn't good old Roger's critiques, in a sense, be art?</span><br>
<span id="y">bleeeehhhhhhhhh no</span><br>
<span id="r">why not?</span><br>
<span id="y">look. if i went out and i sat down and i watched the whole two hour and three minute runtime of The Shape of Water and i had the audacity to get on Twitter while the credits were rolling and say, "the movie was bad. dont watch it. bad." what the hell would the point be.</span><br>
<span id="r">i mean, I don't think Roger would say it quite like that. but like, what does it have to do with the essay on Tuesday?</span><br>
<span id="y">i like making art, <span id="r">Reese</span>. i love sharing my story. that is not what this is.</span><br>
<span id="r">how so? it sure is sharing your perspective. you know, <a href="https://m-a-flynn.github.io/facets/rnc.html" style="border-bottom:1px solid white"><span id="r">semantics like this are right up <span id="c">Cyrus</span>' alley</span></a>, if you'd want to take it up with him.</span><br>
<span id="y">no, youre not getting it. look dude, what is the point? this man made another man in his head, and he had that man make a whole thousand line poem, and then he embodied a <b>completely different man</b>, and then he wrote <b>over two hundred and fifty pages</b> about the poem he <b>just wrote.</b> like...... how could 1250 words ever, ever, ever compare to that? what authority do i, a freshly nineteen c-plus-average girl, have to criticize something like that</span><br>
<span id="r">Nabokov was never a girl, he was never French, and he never wore your size eight-and-a-half shoes. your world is fundamentally different from his. that's what gives you the "authority" to criticise him, and that's why no work is beyond criticism. he's got blind spots and focuses that may (or may not) align with your thoughts, and if you can say why (or why not), then you can help the world see another facet of the piece.</span><br>
<span id="y">well ok here. page 296 into 297 if you want to follow along, which you obviously dont, since im typing it. ahem. "</span><span id="w">Oh, but I cannot express the agony! Instead of the wild and glorious romance – what did I have? An autobiographical, eminently Appalachian, rather old-fashioned narrative in a neo-Popian prosodic style</span><span id="y"> [...] <span id="w">but void of my magic, of that special rich streak of magical madness which I was sure would run through it and make it transcend its time.</span><span id="y">" whew that was a lot. but do you get it</span><br>
<span id="r">... maybe you could make some words about it???</span><br>
<span id="y">uggghhhhh but youre so smart you should just understand my dumb argument. it goes back to my first question.</span><br>
<span id="r">what is the point of commentary?</span><br>
<span id="y">yes. yes. exactly.</span><br>
<span id="r">I still don't get it my dude.</span><br>
<span id="y">god, this is just like <a href="https://m-a-flynn.github.io/facets/mny.html" style="border-bottom:1px solid white"><span id="y">when i talked to <span id="m">Manuel</span> about this stuff</span></a>, except now im on the other side, not getting why you dont get it. <span id="r">Reese</span>, our favorite loony Kinbote adds nothing new here. and by here i mean in the entirety of the commentary here. a truly <b>miniscule</b> amount of what he says adds anything new, and lots of times when it does it wasnt even something crazy Chuck K. wrote, just a scrap from our dearly departed he thinks would be better than what Shade actually wrote in the final version. Kinbote isnt making anything new, he isnt contributing anything with his commentary, hes just commenting because he feels like his viewpoint is valid, which it isnt, and he should just fuck off to his castle or whatever and read more than he writes. so, how do i know im any different</span><br>
<span id="r">... I dont think you can know something like that</span><br>
<span id="y">well thats encouraging, thanks buddy, i guess ill just go to sleep now. thanks for the advice</span><br>
<span id="r">oh, don't be like that. look, nobody can really know for sure whether or not their opinions are "good." what even makes a good opinion, anyways? Even if Ebert knew in his heart of hearts he was always right about film, that just makes him confident, it doesn't really make him right.</span><br>
<span id="y">confidence.</span><br>
<span id="r">sometimes, that's all you really need to put yourself out there.</span><br>
<span id="y">not something im super good at though.</span><br>
<span id="r">yeah, well, theres always today to try.</span><br>
<span id="y">... you might be right.</span><br>
<span id="r">wait did that work. that's never. that's never worked before.</span><br>
<span id="y">eh, well, maybe i just needed the right push from the right person.</span><br>
<span id="r">really, i just said to be confident and you just. decided to be confident. how did you do that</span><br>
<span id="y">magic, i guess.</span><br>
<span id="r">can you teach me how. please.</span><br>
<span id="y">hehe, maybe some day, once i figure it out myself. sweet dreams, <span id="r">Reese</span>.</span><br><br><br>
